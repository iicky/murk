Every `.murk` vault has two layers of encryption for a given key. Picking the
right one is the main decision you make when adding a secret.

## Shared secrets (the murk)

Shared secrets are encrypted to every recipient on the vault. When you run
`murk add KEY`, every authorized team member can decrypt it. This is where
production credentials, third-party API keys, and other team-wide secrets
live.

```bash
# Everyone sees this (prompts for value, hidden input)
murk add DATABASE_URL
```

## Scoped secrets (motes)

Scoped secrets are encrypted to only your key — they live in a reserved
personal group named `me`. When you run `murk add KEY --group me`, the value
is encrypted so that only you can decrypt
it — no other recipient, even one with full vault access, can read it. During
`murk export`, `murk exec`, and `murk get`, a scoped value overrides the
shared value for the same key. That lets you point `DATABASE_URL` at a local
database while the rest of the team uses the shared production value, without
anyone's export clobbering anyone else's.

```bash
# Only you see this; it overrides the shared value during export
murk add DATABASE_URL --group me
```

You can also pipe a value in for scripting — just use a command that doesn't
leak to shell history:

```bash
pbpaste | murk add DATABASE_URL
```

## Choosing between them

- **Shared** — anything the whole team (or CI) needs the same value for:
  production API keys, shared database URLs, third-party service credentials.
- **Scoped** — anything that should differ per developer or stay private to
  you: a local database URL, a personal API token, a value you don't want
  even other recipients to read.

Scoped secrets don't affect who's authorized on the vault — that's the
recipient list, managed with `murk circle` (see [working in
teams](/guides/teams/)). They're a second layer of encryption *within* the
vault, on top of the recipient list. See [how murk's vault format
works](/concepts/vault-format/) for the on-disk details, and the [`murk
add`](/reference/cli/#murk-add) reference for the full flag list.

Note that access control is advisory at the shared layer: any recipient with
`MURK_KEY` and a spot in the recipient list can decrypt every shared secret.
Per-key metadata is not a cryptographic access boundary — use scoped secrets
for anything that should genuinely stay private to one person.
