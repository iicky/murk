murk stores secrets in a single `.murk` file that's safe to commit to git. One key unlocks everything you're authorized to read. There's no server and no runtime dependency, and murk implements no custom cryptographic *primitives*. [age](https://age-encryption.org/) does the encryption, with standard BLAKE3 (keyed integrity) and Ed25519 (signatures) on top. What murk adds is the vault format, how those primitives are composed, and the command-line UX around them.

## Your key is your identity

murk derives your public key from `MURK_KEY` (an inline age secret key) or `MURK_KEY_FILE` (a path to one: a raw age key, an SSH key, or a hardware-backed plugin identity). That public key is what determines which private secrets are yours and which entry in the vault's recipient list is you. See [Environment variables](/concepts/env-vars/) for how murk resolves it, and [Recipients & signatures](/concepts/recipients-signatures/) for how a key gets added to a vault in the first place.

Losing the key means losing access. That's exactly why `murk init` prints a BIP39 recovery phrase.

## The header is public, the values aren't

A `.murk` file is one JSON document. Everything in it is plaintext *except* the secret values and one encrypted metadata blob:

- **Recipients**: the public keys authorized to decrypt the vault. No names, just keys.
- **Schema**: key names, descriptions, examples, and tags for every secret. This is what `murk info` and `murk ls` show, and it works without a key at all.
- **Policy**: an optional allow-list constraining what agents can touch (see [Grants](/concepts/grants/)).
- **Secrets**: age ciphertext, one entry per key.
- **Meta**: a single age blob holding recipient display names, group membership, agent grants, and the integrity/signature data. Encrypted so none of it leaks to a non-recipient.

Anyone with read access to the repo can see what secrets exist and why (`murk info`, `murk ls`), which makes vaults easy to audit and diff in git. Only recipients with a valid key can see the *values*. The full byte-level layout lives in [Vault format](/concepts/vault-format/).

## Three layers for one secret

Every secret has a base tier: either **shared** (encrypted to every recipient, the implicit `everyone` group) or a single **named group** (encrypted only to that group's members), plus an optional personal **private override** (a "mote", the `me` tier, encrypted to just your key).

When you `murk get` or `murk export`, resolution goes in order:

1. Your private override, if you've set one for that key.
2. A named-group value, if you're a member of the group holding it.
3. The shared value.

That layering is what lets a team share most config while keeping per-developer or per-environment values (a personal API key, a `prod`-only credential) out of everyone's hands. [Shared vs scoped secrets](/guides/shared-vs-scoped/) covers the day-to-day workflow for choosing between them.

## Agents get a narrower layer still

Recipients and groups are for people. AI agents and automation get a separate mechanism: a **grant** is an ephemeral, time-boxed identity scoped to a fixed set of keys, excluded from the shared layer entirely. It's never your own key. See [Grants](/concepts/grants/) for how that works.

## What this model does and doesn't buy you

Because any recipient can decrypt every shared secret by design, murk's access control is a convenience and audit boundary, not a hard security perimeter against an insider: a malicious recipient, or an old murk binary, can always read what their key is authorized for. Git is the audit trail: every recipient change, rotation, and grant is a commit. The [threat model](/security/threat-model/) spells out exactly what murk protects against and what it doesn't.
