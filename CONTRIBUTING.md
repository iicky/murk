# Contributing

murk is pre-1.0. Contributions are welcome, especially in these areas:

- Bug reports and security issues (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private reporting)
- Test coverage, especially adversarial/edge-case tests
- Documentation improvements
- Platform compatibility fixes (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Development

```bash
cargo build              # Build
cargo test               # Run all tests
cargo clippy             # Lint
cargo fmt                # Format
cargo run -- <command>   # Run murk with arguments
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR
- Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` before submitting
- PR descriptions should be a short bullet list of changes
- New features must include tests

## Security

If you find a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/iicky/murk/security/advisories/new) instead.
